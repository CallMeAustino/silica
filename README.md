Silica is an HTML / Javascript / webGL / twgl material simulator that renders different materials in browser. Users can click on the 2D Canvas to generate different sand, water, or wall. Each material has different physical properties, and it is up to the user's imagination to play around with the simulation and test how these materials interact with eachother. 

In future releases, this project will include other additional materials and more complex interactions between these materials.
